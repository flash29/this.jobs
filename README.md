Users can build their profile in the settings page by updating their work experience, education, projects, resume and bio.

Anyone can see the profiles of the users and if a connection is a recruiter and they like a profile, they can reach out to them and hire them if they like. Users can easily apply for jobs through one click and the application will be sent to the creator of the job post who has access to all the applicants of the jobs. This application is basically a one stop solution for applicants and recruiters to earn a job or to hire a talented individual, everything in just one easy click, to make our job quest easy!
