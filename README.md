<strong>Description:</strong>
this.jobs is a social media networking application for students, job seekers, recruiters and professionals, to build and expand their network and benefit from it. For students and other job-seeking professionals, it is not only an excellent way to showcase their achievements and accomplishments to catch the attention of recruiters who are seeking out talented individuals but also keep up to date with the Job recruitment, education, knowledge sharing and others. In the posts displayed in the userâ€™s feed, Job recruitments are given highest priority since they are the focus. For recruiters, this is an easy way to post out the job openings and look out for all the applicants in one place and have direct access to their profiles and resume to make the selection process much easier. 

This application has all the basic elements needed for a web application like Registration and Login Page, Home page, connections, Jobs and Profile. Users can build their profile in the settings page by updating their work experience, education, projects, resume and bio. They can connect with any professionals, recruiters, peers by sending them requests or accepting requests from them. Anyone can see the profiles of the users and if a connection is a recruiter and they like a profile, they can reach out to them and hire them if they like. Users can easily apply for jobs through one click and the application will be sent to the creator of the job post who has access to all the applicants of the jobs. This application is basically a one stop solution for applicants and recruiters to earn a job or to hire a talented individual, everything in just one easy click, to make our job quest easy!
